To solve this issue, it is recommended to simplify the calculation by using only one unit type.  Alternatively, you could explicitly convert all units to a common unit (such as pixels) before using the `calc()` function.  For example, instead of `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10em);`, you could calculate the `em` value to pixels based on the current font size and rewrite it as `width: calc(50% - 20px + 150px);` (assuming 1em = 15px).  This ensures consistency across different browsers.  Avoiding complex `calc()` expressions also improves readability and maintainability.
