The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with multiple units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% - 20px + 10em);` might produce unexpected results in certain situations. This is because the order of operations and unit conversions within the `calc()` function can be inconsistent across different browsers.
