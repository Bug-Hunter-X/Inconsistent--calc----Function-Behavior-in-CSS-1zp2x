This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `calc()` function.  The bug arises from inconsistent interpretation of mixed units (percentages, pixels, ems) within a single `calc()` expression across different browsers. The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a potential solution involving more explicit unit conversions or avoiding mixed units where possible.
